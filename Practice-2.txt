Just watched the movie today and oh boy the redesign looks amazing it's almost perfect. That's the reason why i give 10 to the movie because they listen the fans. Now let's talk about the rest. The story is ok we have to remember that the movie is for kids to, but it's still enjoyable. Jim Carrey do a great job as usual and builds perfect into the eggman we know. The CGI looks very good. The soundtrack is feets perfect in the movie. For a guy that grow up with Sonic it was the first game I played when I was seven, I really enjoyed the movie is totally worth it. In the end you can see a really nice surprise.
